# CS-546 Lab 5
## A Recipe API
For this lab, you will create a simple server that provides an API for someone to Create, Read, Update, and Delete recipes. These recipes will be stored in a database named lab5-recipes.

This recipe database will also provide support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting comments for a recipe.

## The recipe object
```json
{ 
  _id: "A uuid",
  title: "Recipe title",
  ingredients: [
    {
      name: "Ingredient name",
      amount: "portion amount"
    }
  ],
  steps: [
    "First step",
    "Second step",
    "Third step"
  ],
  comments: []
}
```

For example, a fried egg recipe:

```json
{ 
  _id: "bd8fa389-3a7a-4478-8845-e36a02de1b7b",
  title: "Fried Eggs",
  ingredients: [
    {
      name: "Egg",
      amount: "2 eggs"
    },
    {
      name: "Olive Oil",
      amount: "2 tbsp"
    },
  ],
  steps: [
    "First, heat a non-stick pan on medium-high until hot",
    "Add the oil to the pan and allow oil to warm; it is ready the oil immediately sizzles upon contact with a drop of water.",
    "Crack the egg and place the egg and yolk in a small prep bowl; do not crack the yolk!",
    "Gently pour the egg from the bowl onto the oil",    
    "Wait for egg white to turn bubbly and completely opaque (approx 2 min)",
    "Using a spatula, flip the egg onto its uncooked side until it is completely cooked (approx 2 min)",
    "Remove from oil and plate",
    "Repeat for second egg"
  ],
  comments: []
}
```

## Comments

Your comment will be stored on the recipe page.

```json
{
  _id: "A uuid",
  poster: "poster name",
  comment: "the comment"
}
```
For example:

```json
{
  _id: "9b527da1-67c0-4c13-ae99-3c1288ff2975",
  poster: "Gordan Ramsay",
  comment: "These eggs are delicious!" 
}
```

##Packages you will use:

You will use the express package as your server.

You can read up on express (Links to an external site.) on its home page. Specifically, you may find the API Guide section on requests (Links to an external site.) useful.

You will use the node-uuid package in order to generate unique id's to use as your identifiers.

You can read up on node-uuid (Links to an external site.) on the Github project page.

You will also use the mongodb (Links to an external site.) package.

You may use the lecture 4 code (Links to an external site.) as a guide.

You may use the lecture 5 code (Links to an external site.) as a guide.

You may use the lecture 6 code (Links to an external site.) as a guide.

**You must save all dependencies to your package.json file**

## Requirements

1. You must not submit your node_modules folder
2. You must remember to save your dependencies to your package.json folder
3. You must do basic error checking in each function
	1. Check for arguments existing and of proper type.
	2. Throw if anything is out of bounds (ie, trying to perform an 
	3. incalculable math operation or accessing data that does not exist)
4. If a function should return a promise, instead of throwing you should return a rejected promise.
5. You must remember to update your package.json file to set app.js as your starting script!
You must submit a zip, rar, tar.gz, or .7z archive or you will lose points, named in the followign format: LastName_FirstName_CS546_SECTION.zip (or, whatever the file extension may be). You will lose points for not submitting an archive.
