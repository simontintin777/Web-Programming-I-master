# CS-546 Lab 10

## Fixing All The Things

Using all you have learned about jQuery, accessibility, and node in general, you will find the (approximately) 11 issues in the simple repository (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for lab 10.

You will submit an updated version of the lab 10 code without accessibility issues, and where the the form sends data back and forth to the server and prints the reply on the page in the paragraph with an id of the-result.

## General Requirements

1. You must not submit your node_modules folder
2. You must remember to save your dependencies to your package.json folder
3. You must do basic error checking in each function
    1. Check for arguments existing and of proper type.
    2. Throw if anything is out of bounds (ie, trying to perform an incalculable math operation or accessing data that does not exist)
    3. If a function should return a promise, instead of throwing you should return a rejected promise.
4. You must remember to update your package.json file to set app.js as your starting script!
5. Your HTML must be valid (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. or you will lose points on the assignment.
6. Your HTML must make semantical sense; usage of tags for the purpose of simply changing the style of elements (such as i, b, font, center, etc) will result in points being deducted; think in terms of content first, then style with your CSS.
7. You can be as creative as you'd like to fulfill front-end requirements; if an implementation is not explicitly stated, however you go about it is fine (provided the HTML is valid and semantical). Design is not a factor in this course.
Your client side JavaScript must be in its own file and referenced from the HTML accordingly.
8. You must pass accessibility tests.
9. You must error-check all forms for common errors.
