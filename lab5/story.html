            <h1>Chapter1: Yun Che, Xiao Che</h1>

                <p>Yun Che’s consciousness gradually awakened.</p> <p>

                What’s going on… How is it that I have not died? I vividly remember that I jumped off Jue Yun cliff, how can I still be alive! Somehow my body is not in pain… And I do not even feel the slightest discomfort? How is this happening?</p> <p>

                Yun Che suddenly opened his eyes and quickly sat up. He found himself in a comfortably soft bed, with a red banner hanging above him, rendering a festive atmosphere.</p> <p>

                “Ah! Xiao Che! You… You woke up!”</p> <p>

                A girl’s gasp of surprise was heard from his ear and the same girl appeared in his line of sight.</p> <p>

                At a glance the girl dressed in green looked to be 15 or 16 years of age. She was as fair as snow with charming rosy lips and a delicate nose. A touching look of deep surprise was expressed by eyes as clear and transparent as a pool of translucent spring water. Her face exuded a dazzling gentleness and softness. At this young age, she already exhibited such charm, who can possibly imagine what sort of beauty she would be in the future.</p> <p>

                Staring at the nearby girl, Yun Che took a closer look and unconsciously let three words escape his lips: “Little Aunt?”</p> <p>

                The fair girl lifted her jade-like hands onto Yun Che’s forehead and relaxed soon after. With a joyful expression, she spoke: “How delightful; your temperature is almost back to normal. You nearly scared me to death. Xiao Che, are you okay? Tell me if you feel uncomfortable anywhere.”</p> <p>

                In the face of the girl’s eyes that filled with deep concern, Yun Che woodenly shook his head. He stared openly into space with a vacant gaze.</p> <p>

                “Rest here for a while, I’ll go and tell your grandpa that you’re awake. Today is your day! When you fainted, your grandfather almost went crazy and personally went to find Dr. Seto for you.”</p> <p>

                The girl was in such a rush that she did not notice the abnormality of Yun Che’s current state. She pushed Yun Che’s shoulders, signaling him to lie back on the bed and hurriedly left.</p> <p>

                As the door shut Yun Che sat up on the bed, hands clutching his head.</p> <p>

                This is one of the cities in the far east located in one of the Seven Empires of the Profound Sky Continent — Floating Cloud City. And he is the only grandson of the fifth Elder in the Xiao clan — Xiao Che! He had just turned sixteen this year.</p> <p>

                That is his current identity.</p> <p>

                Suddenly, his memory overlapped with Cang Yun Continent’s 20 or so years of memory and he burst into confusion.</p> <p>

                If I am Xiao Che… Then why do I have memories of Cang Yun Continent?</p> <p>

                Is it because I traveled to this body after I died in Cang Yun?</p> <p>

                No! I am obviously Xiao Che! This entire room is familiar to me and I clearly remember all the events of my childhood. Everything from my memory was from personal experience and there is no way I would steal another’s memory!</p> <p>

                Then was everything from Cang Yun all just a dream? Was it only after I jumped off Jue Yun cliff that I truly woke up?</p> <p>

                But the memories of living in Cang Yun were as clear as day.. How could those twenty-four years of love and hatred be only just a dream!</p> <p>

                What the hell is going on?</p> <p>

                Yun Che… The now Xiao Che stilled for a long time as he slowly calmed down and settled his thoughts.</p> <p>

                It was still early in the morning and the sky has not fully brightened. Today is his and Xia clan’s big wedding day. Two hours ago he was woken up by his Little aunt and put on his red wedding robe. He ate the porridge his Little Aunt personally made and lost all the strength in his body. He did not remember anything that happened after that.</p> <p>

                He did not wake up until now.</p> <p>

                A strange smell came from his lips and Xiao Che’s lips tucked slightly. His expression darkened.</p> <p>

                This is….. Murdering Heart Powder!!</p> <p>

                In those years that he lived on Cang Yun continent, with the Sky Poison Pearl in his body, Yun Che learned about all the poisons present in the entire world and it could be said that there is no poison he is not familiar with. He could identify a poison’s name and effect with just a whiff. At the same time, because the Sky Poison Pearl, he was impervious. He could not be hurt by any poison, no matter how toxic it was.</p> <p>

                Murdering Heart Powder is made by combining a unique soul grass and the purple striae from a cherry-apple tree. If dissolved in water, the poison is colorless and tasteless. A person would lose his life ten seconds after the poison entered the body and nobody would know the cause of death for it is also a traceless poison.</p> <p>

                Xiao Che’s eyes clouded over and instantly understood what had happened.</p> <p>

                In fact, he did not really faint but instead he drank the porridge containing the Murdering Heart Powder and was poisoned to death! He was born in Cang Yun but after he lept off Jue Yun cliff…. he was actually reincarnated in this world inside a dead body!</p> <p>

                If one were to hear this, it would sound like it came from one of the stories in Arabian Nights but that was the only reasoning Xiao Che could imagine!</p> <p>

                Wait a minute…. if it really was like that, then this body should have no antitoxin ability. How come he is safe from the Murdering Heart Powder on his lips when the previous body’s owner died not too long ago?</p> <p>

                A slightly strange feeling came from the palm of his left hand. Xiao Che lifted his left hand and was surprised to find that there was a circular green imprint on his palm.</p> <p>

                This shape, this color, this size…. was clearly the same as the Sky Poison Pearl!</p> <p>

                Before jumping off Jue Yun cliff, he had desperately swallowed the Sky Poison Pearl but he did not actually know what would happen to him. This mark on his hand was unexpectedly the Sky Poison Pearl and it actually crossed over with him to this world!</p> <p>

                As if in a trance, Xiao Che stared at the Sky Poison Pearl and subconsciously whispered. “Sky Poison Pearl….”</p> <p>

                As his voice dropped off, the green mark on his palm suddenly released a green light. Immediately, a slight dizziness came over him and he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he opened them, his entire world was flooded in green.
